J1-J2-J3 and J1-J2-lambda Heisenberg Model
==========================================


from 2x1 to 4x2 unit cell (PyTorch)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

from 2x1 to 4x2 unit cell (dense YAST)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

J1-J2 model defined on :class:`ipeps.ipeps_abelian.IPEPS_ABELIAN` with extended unit cell

This implementation of SU(2)-symmetric J1-J2 model 
works with dense YAST tensors. In particular, the physical reduced density matrices, 
Hamiltonian terms, observables, etc. are dense YAST tensors. As such, their indices have signature.

.. note::
    The underlying iPEPS wavefunction can make use of explicit internal symmetry and thus 
    block-sparse tensors. After physical reduced density matrices are built from such
    iPEPS and its environment, they are converted to dense form (keeping signature information).

1x1 C4v (PyTorch)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Single-site C4v symmetric IPEPS_C4V supports J1-J2-J3 model and J1-J2-lambda model.
This implementation works with dense PyTorch tensors.
