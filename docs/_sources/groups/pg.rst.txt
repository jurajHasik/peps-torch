Point group: square lattice
---------------------------

Functions symmetrizing (rank-5) on-site tensor by projecting into one
of the irreps of the point-group of square lattice :math:`C_{4v}`.
All functions assume following index convention of on-site tensor:: 

           u s 
           |/ 
        l--A--r  <=> A[s,u,l,d,r]
           |
           d

where first index, `s`, is physical.
